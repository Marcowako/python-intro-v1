# Planning Your Project

## Before You Write Code

The most common sticking point in a project like this isn't writing Python, it's figuring out *what* to write. Students who skip straight to code often end up rewriting functions multiple times because they didn't know what shape their data was in.

---

## Step 1 — Choosing Your API

You'll work with the same API across both weeks, so pick one that genuinely interests you. Three recommended options are listed below. All are free, require no API key, and return data that works well for this project.

### Option 1 — REST Countries

A database of every country in the world, with data on population, area, region, languages, capital city, and more.

- **Base endpoint:** `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all`
- **CLI ideas:** filter countries by region, find the largest or most populous country, compare two countries side by side
- **Option A:** bar chart of the top 10 countries by population or area
- **Option B:** export a clean CSV of country names, regions, populations, and areas
- **Docs:** https://restcountries.com

### Option 2 — Open Library Search

A search API for books and authors. Query by author, title, or subject and get a list of matching books with publication year, subject tags, and page count.

- **Base endpoint:** `https://openlibrary.org/search.json?author=tolkien`
- **CLI ideas:** search for books by author or subject, filter by decade, look up a specific title
- **Option A:** bar chart of books published per decade for a given author
- **Option B:** export search results to CSV with title, author, year, and subject
- **Docs:** https://openlibrary.org/developers/api

### Option 3 — PokeAPI

A complete Pokémon database with stats (HP, attack, defense, speed, special attack, special defense), types, and abilities for every Pokémon.

- **Base endpoint:** `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{name}` (look up one Pokémon at a time by name)
- **Note:** Unlike the other two options, PokeAPI requires a separate HTTP request for each Pokémon you want data on. This is a common real-world API pattern, but it's worth knowing before you start.
- **CLI ideas:** look up a Pokémon by name, compare the stats of two Pokémon, filter a list by type
- **Option A:** bar chart comparing all six stats for a Pokémon, or a head-to-head stat comparison
- **Option B:** build a list from user input and export each Pokémon's stats to CSV
- **Docs:** https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2

> **Using a different API:** If you'd like to use an API not listed here, check with your class's Cohort Instructional Leader (CIL) first. It must be free, require no API key for basic access, and return a list of records that can be structured as a list of dictionaries.

---

## Step 2 — Explore Your API in the Browser

Before opening VS Code, open your API's base URL directly in a browser tab. You'll see the raw JSON response.

Spend a few minutes reading it:

- Is the top-level response a list, or a dict with a key that contains a list?
- What fields does each record have?
- Are any fields nested (dicts inside dicts, or lists inside dicts)?
- Are any fields missing or `null` for some records?

> **Tip:** Install a browser extension like JSON Formatter to make raw JSON easier to read. VS Code also has a built-in prettifier — paste the response into a new `.json` file and use the format document shortcut (`Shift+Alt+F` on Windows, `Shift+Option+F` on Mac).

---

## Step 3 — Answer These Questions Before You Code

Write your answers down — in a comment at the top of `main.py`, in a notebook, or on paper. The format doesn't matter; having the answers written does.

**1. What is the URL you'll call?**
Write the exact endpoint, including any query parameters you plan to use.

**2. What is the shape of the response?**
Is the top-level response a list? A dict with a list inside it? If it's a dict, what key holds the records you care about?

**3. Which 3–5 fields will your program use?**
List the field names exactly as they appear in the JSON. Note if any are nested inside another dict.

**4. What can a user do with your CLI?**
Describe the one core interaction in one sentence. For example: *"A user can type a region name and see all countries in that region."*

**5. Where could things go wrong?**
Name two things that could fail at runtime — a bad network connection, a missing field, unexpected user input — and where in your code you'd handle each one.

## Step 4 — Set Up the Starter Repository

Clone the [starter repository](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/python-intro-final-project) and verify your environment before writing any project code.

**Starter repository structure:**

```
final-project/
├── main.py           ← Start here. Function stubs are defined; you write the bodies.
├── requirements.txt  ← Add third-party packages here (start with: requests)
└── README.md         ← Fill this in as you build. Required for submission.
```

**`main.py` comes with these stubs:**

```python
def fetch_data():
    """Fetch data from the API. Returns a list of dictionaries."""
    pass


def process_data(records):
    """Extract or transform the fields you need. Returns a list of dictionaries."""
    pass


def display_results(results):
    """Print results to the terminal in a readable format."""
    pass


def main():
    """Entry point for the CLI tool."""
    pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You're not required to keep exactly this structure: rename functions, add parameters, split into multiple files if you want to.

**Verify your environment:**

```bash
# In your project directory:
python -m venv .venv
source venv/bin/activate        # macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

pip install requests
pip freeze > requirements.txt
python main.py                  # Should run without errors (does nothing yet)
```

If `python main.py` runs without errors, you're ready for Phase 1.
